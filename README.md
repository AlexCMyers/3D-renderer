# 3D-renderer

When compiled, this program takes in an .obj file as a command line argument, and then renders the 3D image on screen using standard 
computer graphics equations to calculate lighting/color of each pixel.
Two light sources are hardcoded into the program (a main light and then a side light for more depth)

If the submitted obj is defined by triangle faces, then a texture is also created on each face (as opposed to being rendered as thought smooth)
